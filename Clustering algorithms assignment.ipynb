    "Ans: K-means clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms. It assumes that the data can be divided into k number of clusters, where k is a user-defined parameter. It works by iteratively assigning data points to clusters based on their similarity to the cluster's centroid (mean) and updating the centroid until convergence is achieved. This algorithm is widely used in image segmentation, text mining, and customer segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical clustering is a clustering method that creates a hierarchy of clusters. It can be divided into two types: agglomerative and divisive clustering. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point in its own cluster and then combines the closest clusters iteratively until a single cluster is formed. Divisive clustering starts with all the data points in one cluster and then recursively splits them into smaller clusters. This algorithm is widely used in gene expression analysis, social network analysis, and image analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based clustering algorithms, such as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), are based on the assumption that clusters are areas of high-density separated by areas of low density. This algorithm groups together data points that are close to each other in space and have a high density of other points around them. This algorithm is widely used in anomaly detection and fraud detection."

    "Here's how the K-means clustering algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialization:\n",
    "The algorithm starts by randomly selecting k points from the dataset, called centroids, as the initial centroids for the clusters.\n",

    "Once all data points are assigned to clusters, the algorithm calculates the new centroids of each cluster by taking the mean of all the data points assigned to the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reassigning points to clusters:\n",
    "The algorithm repeats step 2 and 3 until the centroids no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached.\n",

    "Ans: Elbow method: The elbow method is a graphical method that involves plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters k. The WCSS measures the sum of the squared distances between each data point and its assigned centroid. The idea is to look for the \"elbow\" or the point on the curve where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down significantly. This point indicates the optimal number of clusters.\n",
